    "Recently, Ligo and Virgo detections has proved the existence of Binary Black Holes systems. Therefore, it is fundamental to investigate what are the formation channels of these compact objects binaries. Several physical processes, such as mass transfer and Common Envelope, and stars composition parameters, such as metallicity, can affect the formation of Binary Black Hole systems.\n",
    "In order to highlight relevant trends and correlations in Binary Black Holes formation, we analyze data simulated with the population synthesis code MOBSE focusing on the parameters of our interest.  \n",

    "Predicted by Einstein’s theory of General Relativity at the beginning the 20th-century, the first direct observation of gravitational waves occurred in 2015, when the merger of two Black Holes has been detected by the LIGO interferometers. This event, named GW150914, confirmed the existence of Binary Black Holes systems and provided the first quite unexpected observations of stellar-origin Black Holes with mass greater than $20 M_\\odot$. The new information provided by this and the following detections can help to improve the current models of compact objects formation and evolution.\n",
    "Most of massive stars in universe are in binary systems. The final part of the in-spiral phase and the merger phase of these systems is the main source of gravitational waves that are strong enough to be detected by the interferometers on Earth. Since many processes can affect the evolution of these systems, the formation channels of compact object binaries are still being investigated. In this project we focus on Binary Black Holes systems made of two stars that form from the same cloud of mat- ter and evolve into two compact objects gravitationally bound."

    "The population synthesis code used for the simulated data-set build-up process is the MOBSE, which stand for Massive Objects in Binary Stellar Evolution. MOBSE is an up-to-date version of one of the most common population synthesis code, BSE. In the code every system is an isolated one (i.e. no interactions with objects outside the system). The main features of the model are an accurate description of the metal-dependency of stellar winds, the dependence of stellar winds on the Eddington factor and new prescription for core-collapse SNe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains a set of population synthesis runs with three different parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **fMT** is the Roche Lobe mass transfer efficiency, whose values under study are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7 and 1;\n",
    "* $\\pmb{\\alpha}$ is the energy removal efficiency (we consider only $\\alpha=5$);\n",
    "* **metal** is the metallicity of the star. The simulation is done on the following values: 0.0002, 0.0004, 0.0008, 0.0012, 0.0016, 0.002, 0.004, 0.006, 0.008, 0.012, 0.016 and 0.02.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, each population synthesis run is organized in different chunks. \n",
    "Each run represents the evolution in time of binary systems for which many pieces of information are stored, among these the main are:\n",
    "* the ID of the binary system;\n",
    "* the current type of the two stars, possible types start from a main sequence star to a compact object;\n",
    "* the current mass of the two objects;\n",
